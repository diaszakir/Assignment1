# Assignment1

Task 1
Task 1: Declare Variables

1.	Create a new Kotlin file in Android Studio.
2.	Declare variables using the following data types:
o	`Integer` (Int)
o	`Floating-point number` (Double)
o	`Boolean` (Bool)
o	String (String)

Instructions:
1.	Declare an integer variable `age` and assign it your age.
2.	Declare a Double variable `height` and assign your height (in meters).
3.	Declare a Bool variable `isStudent` and set it to `true` or `false` depending on your current status.
4.	Declare a String variable `name` and assign your name

Task 2
Using if, else if, and else

Write a Kotlin program that checks a person's age and prints different messages based on the following conditions:
o	If the age is less than 18, print "You are a minor."
o	If the age is between 18 and 65, print "You are an adult."
o	If the age is greater than 65, print "You are a senior."

Instructions:
1.	Use the age variable from Part 1.
2.	Write conditional logic using if, else if, and else to evaluate the variable.
3.	Print an appropriate message based on the condition.

Task 3
Using switch Statement

Write a Kotlin program that uses a switch statement to categorize a person’s life stage based on their age. Use the following conditions:
o	If the age is between 0 and 5 (inclusive), print "You are a toddler."
o	If the age is between 6 and 12 (inclusive), print "You are a child."
o	If the age is between 13 and 17 (inclusive), print "You are a teenager."
o	If the age is between 18 and 64 (inclusive), print "You are an adult."
o	If the age is 65 or older, print "You are a senior."
o	If the age is negative, print "Invalid age."

Instructions:
1.	Use the age variable from Part 1.
2.	Replace the if-else if block with a switch statement.
3.	Include a default case to handle negative ages or ages that do not fit into any other category.
4.	Print a message for each case

Task 4
Combining Conditions

Extend your program from Task 1 from Part 2 by adding more conditions. 
If the person is a student and an adult, print "You are an adult student." 
If the person is a minor or a senior and a student, print "You are a student but not an adult."

Instructions:
1.	Use the isStudent and age variables.
2.	Use logical operators (&&, ||) to combine conditions.
3.	Print the correct message based on the combined conditions.

Task 5
Using for Loop

Write a Swift program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
Instructions:
1.	Use the for loop construct.
2.	Print each number on a new line.

Task 6
Using while Loop

Write a Swift program that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

Instructions:
1.	Use the while loop construct.
2.	Print each number on a new line.

Task 7
Using repeat-while Loop

Write a Swift program that keeps asking the user to enter a number until the number 0 is entered.

Instructions:
1.	Use the repeat-while loop construct.
2.	Print the number entered in each iteration.
3.	Stop the loop when the user enters 0.

Task 8
Mini Calculator

Create a simple calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the user’s choice.

Instructions:
1.	Prompt the user to input two numbers.
2.	Ask the user to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3.	Use a switch statement to execute the correct operation based on the user’s choice.
4.	Handle division by zero cases by printing an appropriate error message.
